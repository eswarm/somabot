# somabot
An automated bartender 

The hardware interfacing is based on libmraa. You can use this on beaglebone black, Raspberry PI or the intel edison/galileo. 

Just select the ingredients in the settings, and the right recipes are populated for generating your cocktails automatically. 

The control software is a webserver you can access from any browser. Built to be responsive, so you can use it either on your mobile or desktop.
